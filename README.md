# Lost soul

This is my entry for the [js13kGames competition](http://2017.js13kgames.com/).

In this game you are constantly running, and have to avoid spikes and holes.

To do that, jump by touching screen or pressing spacebar a short or a longer time to jump higher.

[You can play the game here thanks to the GitHub Pages](https://jonathan-vallet.github.io/lost-lost-soul/index.html).

## Requirements

The project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm (comes with Node.js) to be installed.

## Installing

Run `npm install` in the project directory to install all needed packages.

## Gulp commands

`gulp serve` will host the game

`gulp --production` builds the production version of the project (minified, no sourcemap...).

`gulp zip` creates the zip file for competition and concatenates css/js in a single html file to add more optimisation
